Techincal interviews can be intimidating, but you've been training for this moment! We'll first spend some time sharing personal experiences answering technical interview questions, giving presentations, and tackling coding challenges. Afterwards, we'll practice reasoning and problem solving out loud  using fun mock interview questions.
